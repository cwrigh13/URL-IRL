Product Requirements Document: "The Librarian Who Codes" Showcase Website
1. Overview
This document outlines the requirements for a professional showcase website for a freelance software developer specialising in the Australian public library sector. The website's primary goal is to leverage the unique value proposition of a "librarian who codes" to attract, engage, and convert key decision-makers in Australian public libraries into clients.

Product Goal: To serve as the primary marketing and lead-generation tool by establishing credibility, showcasing expertise, and clearly communicating the unique value offered to Australian public libraries.

Target Audience: The Decision-Making Unit (DMU) within Australian local councils and public libraries, as identified in Section 3.2 of the briefing document. This includes:

Library Managers/Directors: The project champions who need to see a deep understanding of their operational challenges and patron needs.

Council IT Departments: The technical gatekeepers focused on security, data sovereignty, and integration.

Council Procurement/Finance Officers: The budget gatekeepers who require a clear demonstration of value-for-money and adherence to procurement rules.

Success Metrics:

Number of qualified leads generated via the contact form per month.

Number of "Tech Roadmap Workshop" consultations booked per quarter.

Website bounce rate below 50%.

Ranking on the first page of Google for niche search terms like "custom software for Australian libraries".

2. User Personas & Goals
We are building this website for three key personas, each with distinct goals and concerns.

Persona	Role	Goals & Needs	Concerns
Margaret	Library Manager	* Find a tech partner who "gets" libraries and their values. <br> * Solve specific patron problems (e.g., clunky booking systems, disconnected digital services). <br> * Find cost-effective solutions that fit tight budgets. <br> * Get help securing grant funding for tech projects.	* Wasting time explaining library-specific concepts to generic developers. <br> * Being locked into an inflexible system from a large vendor. <br> * The project failing to meet community needs.
David	Council IT Officer	* Ensure any new application is secure and protects patron data. <br> * Confirm data is hosted in Australia. <br> * Understand how the solution integrates with existing council IT infrastructure. <br> * Verify the developer's technical competence.	* The solution creating a security vulnerability. <br> * The application being difficult to maintain or unsupported. <br> * Breaching data privacy regulations.
Susan	Council Procurement Officer	* See a clear, justifiable Return on Investment (ROI). <br> * Ensure the procurement process is simple and compliant (e.g., leveraging SME thresholds). <br> * Understand the full cost of the project with no hidden fees.	* The project going over budget. <br> * A lengthy and complex public tender process for a small project. <br> * The contract terms being unfavourable to the council.

Prompts for Content Generation
If you need help creating the content for this website, you can use prompts like these:

For the "My Story" page: "Write an 'About Me' page for a freelance web developer's website. The target audience is Australian public library managers. The key message is that I used to be a librarian, so I understand their unique challenges and values. The tone should be professional, relatable, and passionate. Mention my journey from librarian to developer and my commitment to public service values like access and equity."

For a Case Study: "Write a portfolio case study about a custom mobile app I built for a public library. The structure should be: The Challenge (patrons were confused by separate systems for ebooks and physical books), The Solution (a unified app with an integrated bookshelf and self-checkout), and The Impact (increased digital loans and positive patron feedback). Make it sound professional and results-oriented."

For a Blog Post: "Generate ideas for a blog post aimed at Australian library managers about technology. The topics should be practical and helpful, establishing me as an expert. Focus on topics like writing a tech brief, leveraging APIs, or preparing for a grant application."
