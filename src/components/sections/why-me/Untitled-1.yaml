+### Executive Summary
+Each funnel aligns to intent and context. The Information Seeker receives low-friction education, progressive profiling, and self-serve tools to build problem and solution awareness before a soft consult nudge. The Problem-Aware Evaluator gets rapid, multi-channel scheduling pathways (email, phone, LinkedIn), role/industry proof, and pre-read materials to compress time-to-value and improve show rates. The Warm Connection leverages the human context from {{conference_name}} and {{rep_name}} with personal video, tailored assets, and lightweight co-creation (mock dashboards) to deepen rapport and secure a meeting.
+
+This segmentation outperforms generic onboarding by matching commitment to intent, using the right channels at the right moments, and capturing the minimum data needed to personalise future steps—maximising engagement, accelerating qualified meetings, and preserving goodwill.
