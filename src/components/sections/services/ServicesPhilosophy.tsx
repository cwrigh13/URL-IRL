              When you work with me, you're not just hiring a developer. You're partnering 
              with a fellow library professional who speaks your language. There's no need 
              to explain the importance of ICIP protocols, the nuances of consortium borrowing, 
              or why a simple, clean interface is so critical for your senior patrons. 
              I get it, because I've been there.

              My goal is to empower your library with the tools you need to do what you do best: serve your community.
